    <div className="App">

        <h1>Nima Hagh Doust - Lab 10 - React</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            To do problem 3 of Lab10, I installed Node.js and npm. Using npm, I ran npx create-react-app my-react-app to start the project, and it will install all the required libraries and tools needed to run a simple react application.
            After navigating to the project folder, I ran <code>npm start</code> to launch the development server.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            I modified the App.js code to create this page using simple js and html. I learned that React components use JSX, which is a syntax extension that allows us to write HTML within JavaScript.
            I also used CSS that was already there and no css was changed.

            One thing I struggled with were the commands to use to start a project in React, but after watvhing some youtube videos and reading the official React documentation
            and following online tutorials to get a better understanding.
