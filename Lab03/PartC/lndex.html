            <h2>Part A: Pure HTML & CSS</h2>
            <p>Part A focused on building a fully responsive webpage using pure HTML and CSS. The implementation required using media queries and custom layouts. One of the challenges in Part A was manually creating breakpoints and managing the layout across various screen sizes. It required more custom code to ensure responsiveness, which could be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies, especially when dealing with different screen sizes and resolutions.</p>

            <h2>Part B: Bootstrap Framework</h2>
            <p>Part B utilized the Bootstrap framework, which simplified the entire process of creating a responsive design. Bootstrapâ€™s predefined grid system and utility classes reduced the amount of custom CSS needed and made the page responsive with minimal effort. The primary advantage of using Bootstrap was the speed of development and the consistency it provides across devices. However, one potential challenge was learning Bootstrap's class structure, which can be overwhelming at first.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Between the two implementations, I found Part B using Bootstrap to be easier, quicker, and more efficient. Bootstrap significantly reduced the amount of custom code and ensured a consistent layout across different devices without much hassle. Part A required more effort and time, but it offered more flexibility for custom styling. Personally, I preferred the Bootstrap approach for its ease of use and speed in developing responsive layouts.</p>
