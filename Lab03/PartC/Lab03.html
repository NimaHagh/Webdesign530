                    In Part A, the task was to create a website using HTML, CSS,
                    and the `@media` function for responsive design.
                    The challenge was manually creating breakpoints to cover
                    different resolutions, such as phones, tablets, laptops,
                    and desktop monitors. I found an online resource that
                    provided common responsive breakpoints, which helped.
                    However, this method took longer and was more challenging
                    compared to Part B. <mark>Please find the link for Part A

                <h2 class="text-center bg-success text-white py-4">Part B</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    In Part B, I was instructed to use Bootstrap to make the
                    page responsive. Right off the bat, this method was easier
                    and faster because most of the CSS was already done for me
                    through Bootstrap's existing classes. Although I was
                    new to Bootstrap, and it took me a little time to get
                    comfortable, after watching a quick tutorial, I got the hang
                    of it.
                    I really enjoyed using Bootstrap, and I will definitely use
                    it again in my personal projects because it's very
                    convenient. <mark>Please find the link for Part B website
